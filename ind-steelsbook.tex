\BackBody{The Talking Heads Experiment, conducted in the years 1999-2001, was the first large-scale experiment 
in which open populations of situated embodied agents created for the first time ever a new shared vocabulary
by playing language games about real world scenes in front of them. The agents could teleport to different 
physical sites in the world through the Internet. Sites, in Antwerp, Brussels, Paris, Tokyo, London, Cambridge
and several other locations were linked into the network. Humans could interact with the robotic agents either
on site or remotely through the Internet and thus influence the evolving ontologies and languages of the 
artificial agents. 

The experiment tested theories of the origins of language and meaning and of the grounding of language in 
real world perception and action. The agents have been endowed with a cognitive architecture that enables them to 
invent their own ontologies and languages and acquire those already existing in the group. Biological principles
such as self-organisation and selectionism played a major role to attain the emergence and continued evolution of 
this agent-based information ecosystem.}
